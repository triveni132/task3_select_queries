## üìò Overview
This task focuses on extracting and filtering data using SQL SELECT queries. The objective was to understand how to retrieve meaningful information from a relational database using clauses like WHERE, LIKE, BETWEEN, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and more.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used
- *SQLiteStudio* for testing queries
- *GitHub* for version control and submission


## üß™ What I Did

### ‚úÖ SELECT Queries Covered

| Query Type                        | Description                                                  |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| SELECT *, specific columns     | Retrieved all or specific data from tables                   |
| WHERE, AND, OR             | Applied filters to narrow down rows                         |
| LIKE                           | Used pattern matching to filter names                       |
| BETWEEN                        | Queried for data within a numeric or date range             |
| IS NULL, IN                  | Checked for missing values and matched against value sets   |
| ORDER BY                       | Sorted results in ascending/descending order                |
| LIMIT                          | Displayed only a specific number of top rows                |
| DISTINCT                       | Removed duplicates from query results                       |
| Aliasing with AS               | Renamed column outputs for better readability               |
| JOIN (Bonus)                     | Combined data from Orders and Users                     |


## üìÇ Files Included

- task3.sql: Contains all the SELECT queries with clear comments
- README.md: Documentation for the task


## üß† Sample Queries Written

Some examples of the queries:
- List all users and their emails
- Find products priced between ‚Çπ500 and ‚Çπ2000
- Select users whose names start with "A"
- Show the top 2 most expensive products
- Retrieve orders joined with user details


## üèÅ Conclusion
This task helped reinforce fundamental SQL skills like projection, filtering, and sorting. I now have a better understanding of how to query and manipulate data efficiently in real-world database scenarios.
